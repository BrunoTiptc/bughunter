# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Instruções para Testes em Português

Para executar os testes, você pode usar o seguinte comando:

### `npm test`

Isso iniciará o executor de testes no modo interativo. Você pode ver os resultados dos testes no console.

Certifique-se de que todos os testes estejam passando antes de enviar suas alterações.

## Rodando os testes (para recrutadores)

Use o comando universal, que funciona em qualquer shell e não depende de ativar o venv:

```powershell
python -m pytest -v
```

Alternativas:
- No Prompt de Comando (cmd.exe): `pytest -v` (se `pytest` estiver disponível no PATH)
- No PowerShell: `.\pytest -v` se houver um executável local `pytest.cmd` no diretório do projeto

Recomendação: prefira `python -m pytest -v` para garantir que os testes rodem sem configuração adicional.

Nota: se `pytest -v` não estiver disponível, executar este comando instala o pytest para o seu usuário e normalmente faz com que `pytest` fique disponível no VS Code:

```powershell
python -m pip install --user pytest
```
